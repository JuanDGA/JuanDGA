## üöÄ Key Interests & Featured Projects

### üß† Artificial Intelligence
I'm deeply interested in the development of intelligent systems and machine learning. Some of my focuses include:

* **
* **AI Challenges on CodinGame**: I enjoy applying AI concepts in competitive programming environments. I've explored solutions for challenges such as:
    * `CodingameSeabedSecurity` (Kotlin): Involving AI, multi-agent systems, and pathfinding algorithms.
    * `CodingameCodeOfZombies` (Kotlin): Focused on algorithmic strategies and agent control.
* **Exploring Graph Theory & AI**: I actively seek the intersection between graph theory and AI applications to model and solve complex problems.

### ü§ñ Robotics
I'm an active member of the **SinfonIA Uniandes Team**. In 2024 we were participating in the RoboCup@Home international competition, and we were the winners. Currently, we are creating the SOTA on social robotics behavioring where we apply:

* **Robot Operating System (ROS)** for system integration.
* Advanced **vision utilities** leveraging **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** for robust perception, supporting complex navigation and manipulation tasks.
* **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to enhance human-robot interaction and natural language instruction understanding.
* AI development and application across diverse platforms, including **Pepper** and, more recently, **G1 robot**, for assistance and service tasks in domestic environments.
